# Librery-System
This is the final project of the class, "Object Oriented Programming Language"(物件導向程式語言). The topic is to build a system that can handle daily works of a library, which include borrowing and returning books, extending return deadline and preorderind books, and looking up information like "where is the book, Farming_Opportunities_in_Orth_Arolina" and "who is the one that read the largest nunbers of books".

圖書館書籍管理系統，輸入EXCEL檔(具書籍資料、使用者ID等)後，可透過該系統查詢書籍資料如狀態與位置等，以及使用者登入並借還書甚至續借與預約。
