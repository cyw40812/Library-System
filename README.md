# Librery-System
This is the final project of the class, "Object Oriented Programming Language"(物件導向程式語言). The topic is to build a system that can handle daily works of a library, which include borrowing and returning books, extending return deadline and preorderind books, and looking up information like "where is the book, Farming_Opportunities_in_Orth_Arolina" and "who is the one that read the largest nunbers of books".
